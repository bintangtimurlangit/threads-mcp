An MCP server for **Meta's Threads** that acts as _your own account_ — read profiles, posts, replies, your timeline & search, and post / reply / quote / like / repost / follow / schedule — from any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.).

> **No developer account.** Unlike the official [Threads Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads) approach (which needs an app, OAuth, and an Instagram Business account), this server drives a **real logged-in browser session** using your own cookies.

## ⚠️ Behave for rate limits

You are automating a **real Threads account**. Meta rate-limits aggressively and can **restrict or ban** accounts that behave like bots — bursty posting, rapid follow/unfollow, like loops. This server helps, but the discipline is on you:

- Writes are **spaced ≥ `THREADS_MIN_ACTION_INTERVAL_MS` (default 8s) apart**, enforced server-side.
- Treat `create_thread`, `follow_user`, `like_thread` as **scarce actions**, not loops.
- If you hit a `🐢 rate-limited` message, **stop for several minutes** — don't retry immediately.
- Reads are cheaper but still hit a real session; results are cached briefly.

---

## Tools

**23 tools.** Posts are identified by a full `url` **or** `handle` + `code` (the shortcode in `.../@user/post/CODE`).

### Read

| Tool                 | What it returns                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `whoami`             | Which account you're signed in as (handle, user id, name, follower/following).            |
| `get_profile`        | A user's bio, follower count, verified status + recent posts. Omit `handle` for your own. |
| `get_user_threads`   | A user's recent posts (their profile feed).                                               |
| `get_thread`         | A single post with its like/reply/repost counts.                                          |
| `get_thread_replies` | Replies under a post.                                                                     |
| `get_timeline`       | Your "For you" home feed.                                                                 |
| `search`             | Search Threads for `posts` or `users`.                                                    |
| `get_followers`      | A partial sample of a user's followers.                                                   |
| `get_following`      | A partial sample of who a user follows.                                                   |
| `get_notifications`  | Your Activity feed — follows, replies, mentions, suggestions. Filterable by `kind`.       |

### Write &nbsp;(rate-limited — real account)

| Tool                                | Action                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create_thread`                     | Post a new thread — text and/or media.                      |
| `reply_to_thread`                   | Reply to a post — text and/or media.                        |
| `quote_thread`                      | Quote-post (repost with your own comment + optional media). |
| `delete_thread`                     | Delete one of your own posts (permanent).                   |
| `like_thread` / `unlike_thread`     | Like / remove a like.                                       |
| `repost_thread` / `unrepost_thread` | Repost / remove a repost.                                   |
| `follow_user` / `unfollow_user`     | Follow / unfollow a user.                                   |

### Schedule

| Tool               | Action                                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schedule_thread`  | Queue a text/media post to publish later (`at` ISO time or `in` duration). |
| `list_scheduled`   | List scheduled posts and their status.                                     |
| `cancel_scheduled` | Cancel a pending scheduled post by id.                                     |

> **Note:** reposting your _own_ post is a no-op on Threads (it silently does nothing) — that's Threads' behavior, not a bug.

### Tool annotations

Per the [MCP annotations spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — side effects at a glance. Write tools act on your **real** account.

---

## Media

`create_thread`, `reply_to_thread`, `quote_thread`, and `schedule_thread` take an optional `media` array — **local file paths and/or `http(s)` URLs** (URLs are downloaded to a temp file first, then cleaned up). Supported: images (`jpg/png/webp/avif`) and video (`mp4/mov/webm`). **Multiple images post as a carousel.** Either `text` or `media` is required.

```jsonc
// text + single image
create_thread { "text": "hello", "media": ["/path/to/pic.jpg"] }

// carousel (multiple images, mix local + URL)
create_thread { "text": "trip 🧵", "media": ["a.jpg", "b.jpg", "https://…/c.jpg"] }

// image-only reply
reply_to_thread { "handle": "someone", "code": "ABC123", "media": ["reaction.png"] }

// quote with a comment + image
quote_thread { "url": "https://www.threads.com/@x/post/ABC", "text": "this 👇", "media": ["chart.png"] }
```

---

## Scheduling

Threads' **web UI has no native scheduling** (it's a mobile / Meta Business Suite feature), so this server runs its own scheduler: jobs are **persisted** to `~/.threads-mcp/scheduled.json` and a poll loop publishes them when due, through the same code path as `create_thread`.

```jsonc
// absolute time (local timezone unless you add an offset like +07:00 or Z)
schedule_thread { "text": "launch 🚀", "at": "2026-07-20T09:00" }

// relative delay
schedule_thread { "text": "in a bit", "in": "2h", "media": ["teaser.jpg"] }

list_scheduled {}                 // → ids + status (pending / done / failed / canceled)
cancel_scheduled { "id": "b9ec…" }
```

### The one hard limit

A cookie/browser approach can only post **while this server process is running** — there's no Threads-side scheduler to hand the job to. So:

- **Short horizons / same session** — works while your MCP client keeps the server alive.
- **Past-due jobs** — fire on the **next startup** (better late than never).
- **Long horizons (days out)** — run the server as an **[always-on daemon](#running-as-a-persistent-daemon)** so it's alive when the job is due.

Local media paths must **still exist** when the job fires (URLs are re-downloaded at fire time).

---

## Setup

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @bintangtimurlangit/threads-mcp   # downloads the CloakBrowser binary (~200 MB, cached)
```

This puts two commands on your PATH: **`threads-mcp`** (the server) and **`threads-mcp-login`** (one-time login). Or run without installing: `npx -y @bintangtimurlangit/threads-mcp`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bintangtimurlangit/threads-mcp.git
cd threads-mcp
npm install          # also downloads the CloakBrowser binary (~200 MB, cached)
npm run build
```

### 1. Log in once

```bash
threads-mcp-login    # global install — or, from a source checkout:  npm run login
```

Opens a CloakBrowser window — log into Threads, then press Enter. Saves your session to `~/.threads-mcp/chrome-profile`. Re-run only when it expires.

### 2. Register with your MCP client

The server launches a **headed** browser, so it needs a display. On a headless machine wrap it with `xvfb-run`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "threads": {
      "command": "xvfb-run",
      "args": ["-a", "threads-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On a machine with a real display, drop `xvfb-run`: `"command": "threads-mcp"`, `"args": []`. From a source checkout, use `"command": "node"`, `"args": ["/absolute/path/to/threads-mcp/build/index.js"]` (wrapped in `xvfb-run` on a headless box).

---

## Running as a persistent daemon

For **reliable scheduling** (and to avoid re-launching the browser each session), run the server always-on under a virtual display. Example with **systemd** on Linux:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/threads-mcp.service
[Unit]
Description=threads-mcp (Threads MCP server)
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xvfb-run -a /usr/bin/node /absolute/path/to/threads-mcp/build/index.js
Restart=on-failure
Environment=DEBUG=false

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now threads-mcp
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"     # keep it running after logout
```

Or with **pm2**: `pm2 start "xvfb-run -a node build/index.js" --name threads-mcp`.

> Note: MCP over stdio expects the client to own the process. Running a standalone daemon is specifically for the **scheduler** to survive between client sessions — the scheduled-post queue is shared via `~/.threads-mcp/scheduled.json`.

## Configuration

All optional — see `.env.example`, copy to `.env` to override.

| Variable                         | Default                         | Purpose                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `THREADS_DOMAIN`                 | `threads.com`                   | Threads domain (`threads.net` redirects here).                            |
| `THREADS_PROFILE_DIR`            | `~/.threads-mcp/chrome-profile` | Where the saved login lives.                                              |
| `THREADS_HEADLESS`               | `false`                         | Keep `false` — headless is detected.                                      |
| `THREADS_MIN_ACTION_INTERVAL_MS` | `8000`                          | Minimum gap between write actions. Raise to be safer.                     |
| `CACHE_TTL_MS`                   | `30000`                         | In-memory read-cache lifetime.                                            |
| `THREADS_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`        | `120000`                        | Ceiling on one browser operation; on timeout the page resets.             |
| `THREADS_MAX_MEDIA_BYTES`        | `67108864`                      | Largest accepted media file (64 MB).                                      |
| `THREADS_MEDIA_TIMEOUT_MS`       | `60000`                         | Per-download timeout for `http(s)` media.                                 |
| `DEBUG`                          | `false`                         | Log startup, captured GraphQL op names, and scheduler activity to stderr. |

State lives under `~/.threads-mcp/`: `chrome-profile/` (your login) and `scheduled.json` (the post queue).

---

## How it works

Threads' web app talks to Meta's **Relay GraphQL gateway** with per-session tokens (`fb_dtsg`, `lsd`) and anti-automation fingerprinting. A hand-rolled `fetch` gets rejected, and operation IDs churn. So this server drives **[CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/cloakbrowser)** — a fingerprint-patched Chromium — against a persistent profile you log into once, and:

- **Reads** — collects the data the app renders: the server-side JSON embedded in each page's `<script>` tags, plus every `/api/graphql` **and** `/graphql/query` response (the home feed uses the latter). A defensive walker pulls posts/users out of _whatever_ comes back, so it survives Meta renaming operations.
- **Writes** — drive the real composer and action buttons so Meta's own client mints the tokens. Icon buttons are clicked at the DOM level (a humanized pointer click misses them). Replies use the inline composer's Ctrl+Enter; reply-with-media promotes it to the full dialog via "Expand composer".
- **Scheduling** — a persisted queue + poll loop, delegating to the same publish path as `create_thread`.

The browser runs **headed** (Meta detects headless); on a server use a virtual display (`xvfb`).

---

## Development

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test             # unit tests (no browser, no login — runs in CI)
npm run test:live    # live READ-only smoke test (needs login + a display)
npm run dev          # tsx watch
```

`DEBUG=true` logs every GraphQL operation name the app fires and each scheduler tick — useful if Meta reshuffles a surface and a reader comes back empty.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                   | Likely cause / fix                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `🔒 Not signed in` on every tool          | No/expired session → run `npm run login`.                                                                                                           |
| A read returns empty for a public account | Try again (feed/timeline is lazy-loaded); run with `DEBUG=true` to see the GraphQL ops. Private/blocked accounts yield nothing.                     |
| A write says it couldn't find its button  | Meta changed the UI, or a promo interstitial got in the way (the server tries to dismiss those). Retry; if persistent, the selector needs updating. |
| `🐢 rate-limited`                         | Stop for several minutes, then slow down.                                                                                                           |
| Scheduled post never fired                | The server wasn't running when it was due — see [Run as a daemon](#running-as-a-persistent-daemon). It'll fire on next startup.                     |
| Headless / server has no display          | Wrap the command in `xvfb-run -a …`.                                                                                                                |

## Caveats

- **Login required.** No session → tools return a friendly "run `npm run login`" prompt.
- **Anti-bot is a moving target.** The free CloakBrowser binary can go stale as Meta updates detection; CloakBrowser Pro ships newer patches. Writes rely on UI selectors Meta can change.
- **Reads are resilient** to GraphQL renames (they parse whatever the app fetches), but a private/blocked account yields nothing, and just-posted content can be briefly stale on read-back.
- **Scheduling only fires while the server runs** (see above).
- Respect Threads' Terms of Service and the rate-limit guidance above. This is for personal use of your own account, not scraping or automation at scale.
